Question: Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?


Answer: 

Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.

Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).


Precedence and associativity are crucial concepts in understanding how expressions with multiple operators are evaluated in JavaScript.

Precedence:
    Definition: Precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated within an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

        Example:
            let result = 2 + 3 * 4; // Multiplication has higher precedence than addition
            // result is 14, not 20 (if addition had higher precedence)

    Common Precedence Levels:
        Highest Precedence: Grouping (()), Unary operators (+, -, !), Increment/Decrement (++, --)
    
        Medium Precedence: Multiplication (*), Division (/), Modulo (%)
    
        Lowest Precedence: Addition (+), Subtraction (-)

    Override Precedence with Parentheses:
        Parentheses can be used to explicitly define the order of evaluation.

        Code:
            let result = (2 + 3) * 4; // result is 20

Associativity:
    Definition: Associativity determines the order in which operators with the same precedence are evaluated. It can be left-to-right (left-associative) or right-to-left (right-associative).

    Example:    let result = 5 - 3 + 1; // Left-to-right associativity
        // result is 3, not 1 (if right-to-left associativity)

    Common Associativity:
        Left-Associative: Most operators, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), etc.
        
        Right-Associative: Assignment operators (=), exponentiation (**).

    Override Associativity with Parentheses:
        Parentheses can also be used to explicitly define the associativity.

    Code: 
        let result = 2 ** 3 ** 2; // Exponentiation is right-associative
        // result is 512, not 64 (if left-associative)
        
Understanding precedence and associativity is essential because it ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly according to the intended order of operations. Misunderstanding or neglecting these concepts can lead to unexpected results and bugs in the code. By being aware of how operators interact and how their precedence and associativity influence expression evaluation, developers can write code that behaves predictably and accurately.
