Question: Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for
each category.

Answer: 

Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands and produce a result. They play a crucial role in programming by enabling you to manipulate data and variables, make decisions, perform arithmetic operations, and more. The essential functions of operators in JavaScript include:

1. Arithmetic Operations:
    JavaScript provides arithmetic operators like + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulo), and ** (exponentiation) to perform mathematical calculations.

    Example: 
        let result = 5 + 3; // result is 8

2. Assignment Operations:
    Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.) are used to assign values to variables. They combine the assignment with an arithmetic operation.

    Example: 
        let x = 10;
        x += 5; // x is now 15
3. Comparison Operations:
    Comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) are used to compare values and produce Boolean results.

    Example:
        let a = 5;
        let b = 10;
        let isEqual = a === b; // isEqual is false

4. Logical Operations:
    Logical operators (&&, ||, !) are used to perform logical operations. They are often used in conditional statements and loops.

    Example: 
        let condition1 = true;
        let condition2 = false;
        let result = condition1 && condition2; // result is false

5. Unary Operations:
    Unary operators (+, -, ++, --) operate on a single operand. They can be used for negation, incrementing, and decrementing.

    Example:
        let num = 5;
        num++; // num is now 6
        
6. Bitwise Operations: Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>) manipulate the binary representation of numbers. They are used in low-level programming and for specific bitwise manipulation.

    Example:
        let binaryResult = 5 & 3; // binaryResult is 1

7.Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
    The conditional operator (? :) is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. It is a concise way to make decisions in code.

    Example:
        let age = 20;
        let canVote = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No"; // canVote is "Yes"
        
Operators are essential in programming because they allow developers to write concise and expressive code, perform calculations, make decisions, and manipulate data efficiently. Understanding and effectively using operators are fundamental skills for any programmer
