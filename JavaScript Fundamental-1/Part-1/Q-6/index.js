// Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names is crucial in JavaScript (and in coding in general) because it greatly improves code readability and maintainability. Clear identifiers make it easier for you and others to understand the purpose of a variable and the role it plays in your code. 

// Not-so-descriptive variable names
let a = 5;
let b = 10;
let c = a + b;

// More meaningful variable names
let firstNumber = 5;
let secondNumber = 10;
let sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
