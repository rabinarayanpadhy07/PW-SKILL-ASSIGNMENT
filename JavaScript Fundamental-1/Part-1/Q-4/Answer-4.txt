Question: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the 'let' keyword?


Answer:

Declaring variables in JavaScript allows you to store and manipulate data in your programs. Variables act as containers for values, making your code more flexible and dynamic.

Example 1
    let myVariable = 42;

Example 2
    let x = 10, y = 20, z = 30;
