 HTML Entities:
HTML entities are special codes that represent reserved characters, symbols, or characters with specific
meanings in HTML. They are used to display characters that might otherwise be interpreted as HTML code or
cause rendering issues in web browsers. HTML entities are written using an ampersand (&) followed by a
specific code or name, and ending with a semicolon (;).
