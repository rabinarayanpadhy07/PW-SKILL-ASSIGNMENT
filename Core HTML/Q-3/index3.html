            Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. Web
            developers typically specialize in front-end development, back-end development, or full-stack development.
            Front-end developers are responsible for the design and user experience (UX) of a website. They code the
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up a website's visible elements.
