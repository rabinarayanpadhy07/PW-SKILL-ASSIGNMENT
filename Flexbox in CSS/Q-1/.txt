1.Describe the main diffrence between the css flexbox layout model and the css grid layout model,when would you choose to use one over the other ?

(ANS) The main diffrence between the flexbox and css Grid layout models lies in their layout startegies
 and how they arrangement of elements.

flexbox-: It is primarily designed for one-diemensional layouts,focousing on distributing space and alligning items
along a single axis (either horizontaly or vertically). its best suited layouts where you have a row or column of items,
such as navigation menus,card-based designs,or centering content within container.

CSS Grid-: it is designed for two diemensional layouts, allowing you to define both rows and columns,it creates a grid of cells
where content can be placed in any cell or span across multiple cells, CSS grid is deal for complex grid-based designs like magazine
layouts ,forms,and any layout where content needs to be placed in a precise grid-structure.

Choosing Between flexbox and CSS Grid depends on Your specific layout requirements.

I might choose flexbox when you need to arrange items along a single axis, for example,when creating navigationbars,header/footer
layouts , or aligning elements within container. Flexbox is great for responsive
designs where items can be vary in size.

I might choose CSS Grid when you need to create more complex,two-diemensional layouts with rows and columns.
it's particulary usefull for when you have grid-like structure,such as galleries,forms with multiple fields.
or any designs that requires precise control over both rows and columns.

In some case you might have even combine both Flexbox And Css Grid within a single layouts to leverage the strength of each model for diffrent parts of your webpage.
