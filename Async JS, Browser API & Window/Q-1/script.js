/** 
 * (Q) Define XMLHttpRequest object, and How is it used in AJAX ?
 * 
 * ANS -: The XMLHttpRequest object is a built-in browser object that allows JavaScript to make HTTP requests to servers without having to reload the page. It is commonly used in AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to send and receive data from a server asynchronously, without interfering with the behavior of the existing page.
